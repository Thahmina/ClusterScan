ClusterScan
====================
What is ClusterScan?
-------
ClusterScan is a tool which search for genomic clusters starting from a feature annotation. It allow the user to scan an annotation file (BED format) and get clusters coordinates in output. ClusterScan also need an additional two-columns file storing the feature names and the corresponding accession (including Gene Ontology, KEGG, Pfam accessions, etc). The user can also use a custom set of accessions, making ClusterScan very flexible.
